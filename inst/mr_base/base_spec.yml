metaid: base

descr: |
  Base run that generates core information in regdb database
  and performs checks by comparing results from original run,
  base run and translation to R.

# Parcels that contain data stored in regdb tables
regdb_parcels:
  base_core:
    descr: |
      Core information for base run.
      This parcel will be loaded by most metareg studies
      in order to compare with baseline results and to get
      basic regression information.
    variants: [sb,rb]
    tables: [header, reg, regcheck, regcoef_diff]

  base_cmdpart:
    tables: [cmdpart]

  base_regsource:
    tables: [regsource]

  base_regcoef:
    descr: |
      Base run. This parcel will be loaded by most metareg studies
      in order to compare with baseline results and get
      basic regression information.
    variants: [sb,rb]
    tables: [regcoef]

  org_regcoef:
    descr: |
      Regression coefficients of original run. Ideally,
      are the same than in the base run.
